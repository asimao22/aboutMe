                <p class="animated fadeindown delay-2s">Hello! I'm Alison Simao. I am a 22 year old college student currently studying Graphic Design at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. 
                I've lived in Rhode Island my entire life, and was lucky to grow up in a home with a lot of family around. 
                <br> I have loved art ever since I was a kid. Some of my earliest memories are of being at home watching
                Bob Ross on my tv creating paintings that blew my mind. I knew from that point I wanted to somehow create something of that magnitude myself. Of course, three year old Alison could only
                scribble at that point. As I grew older, I began to experiment and dive into various
                mediums and styles of art. I am a designer, a photographer, and a painter. 
                <br>In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, traveling around wherever I can, and lately, teaching myself about live sound production (I am a massive music nerd). 
                <br>
                <br>Whatever allows me to express creativity, makes me feel free.</p>
